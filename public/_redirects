# Netlify redirect rules for SPA (Single Page Application)
# This tells Netlify to serve index.html for all routes and let React Router handle client-side routing

# Redirect all routes to index.html with 200 status (not 404)
/*    /index.html   200

# Optional: Redirect old paths if you have any
# /old-path    /new-path    301

# API routes should be handled before the catch-all rule if you have any
# /api/*    https://your-api-domain.com/api/:splat    200
